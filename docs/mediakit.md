Media kit lives under [`_src/mediakit/`](../_src/mediakit/). The folder structure will be reflected in the final zip file always available under [https://www.bigchaindb.com/mediakit.zip](bigchaindb.com/mediakit.zip). Currently, the media kit download button lives on the [About page](https://www.bigchaindb.com/about/).

The zip file will be created automatically upon site build. File names in the `logo` folder should not be changed, those assets are used on the About page for the logo downloads.

## Editing media kit

All contents of the `_src/mediakit/` folder can be edited on GitHub. Whatever is put in there will be part of the final zip package after the next site build and deployment. Ideally, always create a Pull Request when adding multiple files so all of them are deployed at the same time.
