Media kit lives under [`_src/_assets/mediakit/`](../_src/_assets/mediakit/). The folder structure will be reflected in the final zip file always available under [https://www.bigchaindb.com/mediakit-bigchaindb.zip](https://www.bigchaindb.com/mediakit-bigchaindb.zip).

The zip file will be created automatically upon site build. File names in the `logo` folder should not be changed, those assets are used on the About page for the logo downloads.

## Editing media kit

All contents of the `_src/_assets/mediakit/` folder can be edited on GitHub. Whatever is put in there will be part of the final zip package after the next site build and deployment.
