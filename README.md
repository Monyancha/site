## Development

The whole website is a Jekyll based site with a Gulp-based build pipeline in front of it.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed on your development machine before moving on:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) (for sanity, install with [rvm](https://rvm.io/))
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

### Get up and running

Run the following command from the repository's root folder to clone this repository, install all dependencies, and spin up local dev server reachable under [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bigchaindb/site.git
cd site/
npm i && bundle install

# development build and dev server
gulp
```

Additionally, you can execute those commands to test the actual build output:

```bash
# full production build
gulp build --production

# build preventing search engine indexing & Google Analytics tracking
gulp build --staging
```

All builds are output into the `_dist/` folder. Use a tool like [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) to inspect a local build in your browser:

```bash
serve -s _dist
```

## Continuous deployment: always be shipping

![shipping](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/90316/26559768/e21e9724-44b1-11e7-90cf-6ef6ebb06d09.gif)

The site gets built & deployed automatically via Travis. This is the preferred way of deployment, it makes sure the site is always deployed with fresh dependencies and only after a successful build.

Build & deployment happens under the following conditions on Travis:

- every push builds the site
- **live deployment**: every push to the master branch initiates a live deployment
- **beta deployment**: every new pull request and every subsequent push to it initiates a beta deployment

## Manual deployment

For emergency live deployments or beta & gamma deployments, the manual method can be used. The site is hosted in an S3 bucket and gets deployed via a gulp task.

### Prerequisite: authentication

To deploy the site, you must authenticate yourself against the AWS API with your AWS credentials. Get your AWS access key and secret and add them to `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

This is all that is needed to authenticate with AWS if you've setup your credentials as the default profile.

If you've set them up as another profile, say `[bigchaindb]` you can grab those credentials by using the `AWS_PROFILE` variable like so:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=bigchaindb gulp deploy --live
```

In case that you get authentication errors or need an alternative way to authenticate with AWS, check out the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html).

### Staging build & beta deployment

The staging build is a full production build but prevents search engine indexing & Google Analytics tracking.

```bash
# make sure your local npm packages & gems are up to date
npm update && bundle update

# make staging build in /_dist
gulp build --staging

# deploy contents of /_dist to beta
gulp deploy --beta
```

There's also a second beta deployment target called gamma under http://gamma.bigchaindb.com:

```bash
# build preventing search engine indexing & Google Analytics tracking
gulp build --staging

# deploy contents of /_dist to gamma
gulp deploy --gamma
```


### Production build & live deployment

```bash
# make sure your local npm packages & gems are up to date
npm update && bundle update

# make production build in /_dist
gulp build --production

# deploy contents of /_dist to live
gulp deploy --live
```

## Coding conventions

### (S)CSS

Follows [stylelint-config-bigchaindb](https://github.com/bigchaindb/stylelint-config-bigchaindb) which itself extends [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard).

Lint with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) in your editor or run:

```bash
npm test
```

### JavaScript

It's a wild mess right now between old school vanilla js, jQuery and some ES2015 features. Don't bother with the old stuff unless dependency updates break it.

New js should follow [eslint-config-ascribe](https://github.com/ascribe/javascript). Linting in this repo is not setup for it yet.
