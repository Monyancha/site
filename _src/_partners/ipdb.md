IPDB  —  the Interplanetary Database  —  is made up of two parts: a blockchain-style database for the world computer and a not-for-profit foundation that guides it. The IPDB foundation provides governance for the database, guiding its growth and allowing it to respond to any challenges it faces.

The foundation’s members are the caretakers, and each runs a server node that stores and validates transactions. Together these nodes make up the IPDB database. IPDB offers a public platform for trust, backed by the reputation of the caretakers.
