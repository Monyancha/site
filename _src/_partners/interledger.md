Interledger and the Interledger Protocol (ILP)  make it easy to send and receive money, no matter what ledger you or the recipient are on. By connecting different payment networks, no global coordinating system or blockchain is needed.  It uses ledger provided escrow—conditional locking of funds—to allow secure payments through untrusted connectors.
