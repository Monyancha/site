The artificial ecosystems created by humans are not necessarily in balance with those natural, smart ones. That is why BIOSFERA develops implementation frameworks that make human ecosystems smart. We call this Smart Ecosystem Engineering (SEE).

SEE gives natural ecosystems a voice and a face so that they can participate in the distribution and the exchange of the value that they generate for us, for all life on earth and for the Biosphere as a whole.

Biosfera has developed the operating system for Smart Ecosystems called TUPIX. TUPIX allows both the ecosystems and the communities of dependent actors to monitor, manage and control this distribution and exchange of value in real-time, secure and transparent.
