I have been involved in the Blockchain industry full-time since 2013 and this is the first true solution I have seen that resolves many of the restraints with the Bitcoin blockchain.  Not only is the technology associated with BigchainDB fantastic but the approach, team, and scalability potential is unparalleled.  I am excited to watch it unfold.'

  quote: 'I think distributed databases and Blockchains can learn a lot from each other. BigchainDB is the logical next step in scaling non-computational blockchains, especially when storing larger datasets on a permission basis.'
