Working to put intellectual property on the blockchain (IP over IP) since August 2013, it became clear that scalability was a fundamental barrier to wider adoption of blockchain.

We released a whitepaper in early 2015 highlighting the ideal characteristics of a scalable blockchain and a few months later, we decided to try to tackle the scalability problem ourselves. By December 2015, we came up with a solution that was quickly piloted with several industry clients.

The result is Bigchain, a blockchain for the world.
