The BigchainDB Test Network is operated by BigchainDB:

BigchainDB GmbH
Wichertstr. 14A

Aktenzeichen VR 35270 B

If you have questions about the BigchainDB Test Network or these Terms, please email contact@bigchaindb.com.

### 2. Your Use of the BigchainDB Test Network

The BigchainDB Test Network is for testing purposes only. That’s why it’s called the Test Network! You get to see what you can build on BigchainDB, and we get to see how you will use BigchainDB.

Your use of the BigchainDB Test Network is subject to these Terms. If you do not agree with the Terms, you may not use the BigchainDB Test Network.

Your use of the BigchainDB Test Network is at our discretion. We can allow or deny access at any time and for any reason.

Right now the BigchainDB Test Network is free. We intend to charge for use of the network in the future. We can set pricing at our discretion.

### 3. Your Role as a Tester

By using the BigchainDB Test Network, you agree to be a Tester. Beyond just using the BigchainDB Test Network, we make a few requests of our Testers:

1. Keep your transaction volume to a minimum. Right now we are testing the basics, not the throughput of the network.
2. Talk to the developers. From time to time we will ask questions about how you are using the BigchainDB Test Network, what features you would like to see added, or how we could improve. You agree that suggestions you make for improvement of BigchainDB Test Network become the property of BigchainDB. We may credit you in code notes or other documentation if we see fit and you wish to be credited.
3. Report security vulnerabilities or other bugs. If you find security vulnerabilities or other flaws in the BigchainDB Test Network or the underlying software, we ask that you report them to us immediately.
4. Be nice. We are trying to build something as a public good, for the benefit of the internet as a whole. Don’t mess that up by using the BigchainDB Test Network for anything illegal, inappropriate, or just icky.

### 4. Privacy

For the time being, information collected by BigchainDB may be shared with BigchainDB GmbH for the purposes of developing the BigchainDB software that powers BigchainDB. You may be contacted by members of BigchainDB or BigchainDB with questions about your use of the BigchainDB Test Network.

Information collected and shared will include:

1. Your name and contact information.
2. Your organization.
3. Your project and details about it.
4. Your use of the BigchainDB Test Network and suggestions for its improvement.
5. Your public key used to write transactions to the BigchainDB Test Network.
6. The content of your transactions on the BigchainDB Test Network.

### 5. Legal Stuff

TL;DR: The BigchainDB Test Network in its current form is unreliable and shouldn’t be used for anything important! It’s for testing purposes only. We aren’t responsible for anything that happens on it. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
